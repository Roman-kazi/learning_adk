# Agent Development Kit (ADK) Learning

This repository contains code related to the **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**.

It serves as a collection of examples and projects to help with the process of learning and experimenting with building intelligent agents using the Google ADK.

This repository covers various aspects of agent development, including:

* **Agent Logic:** The core code that defines the agent's behavior and responses.
* **API Integration:** Examples of connecting the agent to external services and data sources.
* **Documentation:** Notes and resources gathered during the learning process.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as a starting point for building your own intelligent agents.
